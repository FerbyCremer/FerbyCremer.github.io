                        For editing 3D spatial data, 3D interaction through virtual reality (VR) can be a viable alternative to 2D interfaces: research indicates that model editing in VR provides a more enjoyable experience and 
                        is fast to learn. These advantages make VR an appealing option for training new users’ spatial understanding before transitioning to standard 2D tools, like Blender and Maya. But how much does model 
                        editing in VR benefit the trained user? Our experiment compares the modeling accuracy of non-modelers, casual users, and formally trained artists for objects of varying complexity in desktop and 
                        VR. For users with no prior modeling experience, the study found significant improvements in qualitative accuracy and efficiency of aesthetic edits using VR. Importantly, improvements decreased with 
                        higher user experience and varied with types of editing for different surface features. The findings suggest that adaptation of traditional desktop modeling tools to VR should be situational decisions based 
                        on specific modeling scenarios.

                        Interpreting 3D information based on 2D slices of the data is notoriously difficult. Yet in the medical field makes intervention choices
based on radiological scans on a daily basis. Volumetric reconstructions of these data sets, via voxel clouds and surface meshes
can reduce the cognitive complexity of this task. However, creating
these reconstructions requires extensive software training and time,
often on the part of a technician separate from the treatment team.
To shorten this process, we present a system designed for radiologists and surgeons on the care team. We integrate tools familiar
to these experts and provide a stereoscopic environment for quick
spatial comprehension and intuitive data curation. Based on the
feedback from oncology collaborators on the system in its current
state, it is not only helpful for communicating tumor progression
but, additionally shows promise as a teaching tool to assist with
building skills for traditional interpretation of radiology images.

                        The prevalent evaluation methods used to estimate detection of
redirected walking are based on methods from psychophysics that
require users to know their virtual movements are being manipulated. However, this higher-than-normal level of attention toward
their movements yields conservative detection thresholds. We find
that participants who were unaware that redirected walking (translation gain) was applied detected the technique at a significantly
higher gain than users who were aware (at gains of 1.73 and 1.38,
respectively). We provide evidence that redirected walking-based
navigation solutions may be able to leverage gain values that are
larger than the current threshold guidelines would suggest.
