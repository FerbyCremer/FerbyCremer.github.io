1.) What is the central idea of your concentration? (500 characters max)

Fractals are a visual expression of a mathematical equation, typically in the form of a repetitive patter.  I chose to explore the behavior of atoms during the process of expending energy.  I used the equations of vector forces to create paths for the represented particles,manipulating direction and density. In short I am exploring the chaos theory as exhibited in acts of pure energy.



2.) How does the work in your concentration demonstrate the exploration of your idea? (1350 character max)

The force of expanding energy is often unseen as air particles are compressed into waves with deliberate directions. As I progressed through the exploration of this concept I added more equations to account for environmental differences that could be encountered and altering parameters of the core equation that represented the explosion to explore different types of explosions. I found many nuances with minor alterations, like the vastly opposing images that can be generated simply by flipping the polarity, as seen in pieces 5 and 6, or be changing the degree of a variable we go from the high energy scene of piece 7 to the highly organized state of piece 8. There is also great subtlety to be found by using multiple related equations, much like those of the trigonometric family, as opposed to a few, highly intricate equations, a process explored in both piece 3 and piece 10. One of the most pleasing and effective methods discovered during this concentration was the power of using the same equation over and over, changing only the strength of the equations and the size of the area they were assigned to, as exhibited in pieces 4, 8, 9, and 12.
